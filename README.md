# all-about-me

The idea of this repository is to simultaneously learn Java while working on something that seems interesting: tracking personal details over the course of a decent amount of time (months, years) and discovering insights. For example, is there a connection between weather and number of hours of sleep? Is the full-moon sleep theory real? Does my chess rating get better as my expenses decrease? 

Progress will be slow as I learn the ins and outs of Java, but I hope to produce a meaningful, interesting application in due time.
